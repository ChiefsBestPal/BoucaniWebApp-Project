## NB: "proxy" in package.json
If one were to change the host and/or port of the server this app is hosted on,
please change the "proxy" field in the package.json to the right URI 
AND if on cloud platform, or requiring DNS or something else, 
PLEASE start an issue for it to be integrated, and then complete it or at least assign yourself to it.
